Here I publish posts in irregular intervals
about things I do or want to be able to look up later.

I suggest new visitors to take a look at the following highlights
instead of scrolling chronologically.

* [Number of longest increasing subsequences]({filename}/en/paper-lis2.md)
   about a academic publication, of which I am co-author, and its central algorithm
* [Perfect Snake]({filename}/en/perfect-snake.md) presents an implementation of the
   game snake with a neural net based autopilot.

Unfortunately, most content is only available on the [German version of this blog](https://blog.schawe.me).
But even if you do not speak German, [this post about fractals](https://blog.schawe.me/randomFractals.html)
should be nice to look at anyway.
